# THIS IS A KEYLOGER MADE IN C++ FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY
I do not support or endorse any form of spying, stalking, or the spread of malware/spyware/viruses by blackhats hackers.
This keyloger was developed by myself to learn more about cybersecurity.

- keyloger.cpp generates keyloer.exe after compiled
- Program will log every KEYUP (or key release) event from the keyboard
- Pressing ALT+9 terminates the log
- A file intercept.txt is generated locally with the logged keys
